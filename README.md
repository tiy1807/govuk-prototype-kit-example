# GOV.UK Prototype Kit Example

This example shows:

* use of nunjucks
* error messages

It makes extensive use of [Vicky Teinaki's efficient prototyping tips](https://medium.com/gov-design/more-efficient-prototyping-with-the-gov-uk-prototype-kit-step-by-step-84ea2832549a).

## About the Prototype Kit

Go to the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit site](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs) to download the latest version and read the documentation.

The Prototype Kit provides a simple way to make interactive prototypes that look like pages on GOV.UK. These prototypes can be used to show ideas to people you work with, and to do user research.

Read the [project principles](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/principles).

## Make sure prototypes are password-protected

If you publish your prototypes online, they **must** be protected by a [username and password](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/publishing-on-heroku). This is to prevent members of the public finding prototypes and thinking they are real services.

You must protect user privacy at all times, even when using prototypes. Prototypes made with the kit look like GOV.UK, but do not have the same security provisions. Always make sure you are handling user data appropriately.
